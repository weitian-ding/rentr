# Rentr
A platform that allows students or people in general :wink: to look for apartment/house rentals. It is exactly like Airbnb except the platform does not automate rent payments. 

I was very frustracted every time I try to look for an apartment on Facebook groups or other websites because there is always a lot of information missing, such as whether the place has laundry or whether the room is female only. Time was wasted when I try to reach the place owners for the answers.  

Also, I was very passionate about AngularJS and Node.js at that time, so I created this repository. I will continue the development until I am able to launch it to a small group :relaxed:.
